## üìÅ Data Model

The data model was built by connecting multiple fact and dimension tables to enable meaningful analysis. 

### üßæ Fact Tables

| Table Name                 | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `fact_sales_monthly`       | Monthly gross sales data per product and customer |
| `fact_gross_price`         | Product price details                             |
| `fact_manufacturing_cost`  | Manufacturing cost per product                    |
| `fact_pre_invoice_deductions` | Discounts applied before invoicing            |

### üß≠ Dimension Tables

| Table Name     | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `dim_customer` | Customer information (name, region, etc.)     |
| `dim_product`  | Product details (code, segment, division)     |
| `dim_market`   | Market-related geography info                 |
| `dim_date`     | Calendar information (year, month, quarter)   |

### üîó Relationships

- Products and sales are linked using `product_code`
- Customers and sales are linked via `customer_code`
- Dates are joined through `date` or `fiscal_year`
- Discounts and costs are associated at the product level

This star schema helped drive efficient querying and visualization in Power BI.
